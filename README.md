The framework I have decided to choose to research is "Bootstrap". Bootstap is a framework that was once known as "Twitter Blueprint". This framework is also known as a framwork that devlops responsive and mobile first websties. With using Bootstrap it helps developers allow them to finish the project effiecently. 

The reason why I choose Bootstrap is because I am not farmiliar with many frameworks, I am usually not so great with web development. This way by choosing Bootstrap I can learn to become more proficent with the framework. With the times I have learned to use Bootstrap I have overall really enjoyed it, it is a good challenge, but not so difficult that I don't understand the concept.
